# PetsGallery App
A SwiftUI video-based application with AVPlayer and the Pexels API that is full of various cute pets videos in 5 categories. The App contains different components and views, with JSON data, JSON data conversion into a custom SwiftUI model, API is called asynchronously, and also uses AVPlayer (from AVKit) to integrate the media player. I built this App for my crush Jason Yu as his birthday gift.
